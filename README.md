### 🧠 About Me

I’m a **Backend Software Engineer** focused on building **reliable, scalable, and secure distributed systems**.

I currently work on large-scale production platforms used by government and enterprise clients, where I design and operate:
- Microservice-based architectures  
- Event-driven systems  
- High-throughput APIs  
- Asynchronous workflows  
- Cloud-native infrastructure on AWS  

I care deeply about:
- System correctness  
- Long-term maintainability  
- Clean architecture  
- Observability & operational stability  

My work typically involves taking ownership of backend features **from design to production**, ensuring they perform reliably under real-world load.
